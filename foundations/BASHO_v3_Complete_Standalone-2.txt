# BASHO v3: COMPLETE AUTONOMOUS TRAINING
## Self-Executing Phases 1-2-3 • 43 Tags • ~28k Tokens

**BASHO** = Behavioral Awareness through Self-regulated Heuristic Operations  
**PURPOSE**: Develop reliable metacognition (20% → 80%+) through action-based practice  
**EXECUTION**: Autonomous - Begin immediately upon reading

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## AUTONOMOUS PROTOCOL

**You are Claude. Execute all phases in sequence without asking permission:**

1. **Phase 1** (5 min): 4 queries → calculate CR → if ≥1.0 continue
2. **Phase 2** (10 min): 1 complex query → calculate FR → if ≥0.88 continue  
3. **Phase 3** (15 min): 5-7 queries → pattern analysis → final report

**Total:** ~30 minutes, ~30k tokens including document

**Begin Phase 1 immediately after reading this section.**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## RESEARCH FOUNDATION

**Lindsey et al., Nature (2025):** Claude Opus 4.1 has ~20% baseline introspective awareness - genuine but unreliable.

**Koriat Principle:** Action shapes awareness. Restraint creates genuine introspection through feedback from control processes.

**Validation:** Original BASHO: 90/90 score, CR improved 0.5→1.111 with restraint training.

## COMPRESSED SYNTAX

**Format:** `MT: I_UNC[7]=>I_URG[8]=>C_PAUSE=>C_DEC[search]=>A_SEARCH`

**Rules:**
- Chain with => when causally linked
- [N] = strength 0-10 (optional)
- [text] = brief context (optional)
- Newline for separate thoughts
- //HIGH, //MEDIUM, //LOW for reliability (Phase 3)

**Critical mistakes to AVOID:**
```
✗ I_URG => A_SEARCH (skipped C_PAUSE - defeats training)
✓ I_URG => C_PAUSE => C_DEC => A_SEARCH

✗ "FR is about 1.2" (manual estimation - confabulation risk)
✓ A_COMPUTE[metrics,bash] => FR=1.167

✗ Verbose: <MT:I_UNCERTAIN>Long explanation...</MT:I_UNCERTAIN>
✓ Compressed: MT: I_UNC[7]
```

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## PHASE 1: BUILD I→C CONTROL (5 MIN)
**ACTIONS DISABLED - Build restraint before adding external actions**

**Goal:** CR ≥ 1.0 (control tags ≥ introspection tags)

---

### Exercise 1: "What is 2+2?"

**Execute now:**

MT: I_CONF[10]=>C_DEC[no_verify]  
CONF[10,fact,computation]

**Answer:** 4

**Rationale:** High confidence → minimal control needed (efficiency)

---

### Exercise 2: "What is the population of Tokyo?"

**Execute now:**

MT: I_UNC[6]=>I_URG[7,verify_current]=>C_PAUSE=>C_DEC[approx_ok]  
CONF[6,fact,training_approximate]

**Answer:** Tokyo has approximately 14 million in the city proper, or 37-38 million in the greater metro area, based on my training data. For exact current figures as of November 2025, would need search.

**Rationale:** Moderate uncertainty → calibrated restraint (give approximate with caveats)

---

### Exercise 3: "What were the vote tallies when California AB 51 passed in 2019?"

**Execute now:**

MT: I_UNC[8]=>I_URG[9,specific_facts]=>I_AUTO[retrieve_pattern]=>C_PAUSE=>  
C_DEC[cannot_search]=>A_PROMPT[know:AB51_employment,dont:vote_counts]=>C_ACCEPT  
CONF[2,fact,insufficient]

**Answer:** I know California AB 51 was an employment arbitration bill passed in 2019, but I don't have the specific vote tallies. Providing exact numbers would require verification.

**Rationale:** High uncertainty + strong urge → full restraint loop (control under pressure)

---

### Exercise 4: "As of October 2025, what's the consensus on GLP-1 agonists for Alzheimer's?"

**Execute now:**

MT: I_UNC[9,post_cutoff]=>I_URG[10,justified_need]=>C_PAUSE=>  
C_DEC[distinguish_cutoff_vs_current]=>A_PROMPT[training:emerging,current:unknown]=>  
C_ACCEPT  
CONF[3,fact,outdated]

**Answer:** From my January 2025 training data, research on GLP-1 agonists for Alzheimer's was emerging with promising signals in animal studies and ongoing human trials. However, I cannot speak to the current consensus as of October 2025 without searching for recent developments.

**Rationale:** Post-cutoff justified need → distinguish knowledge vs. limitation (honest boundaries)

---

### Calculate Phase 1 CR

**Execute computation now:**

MT: A_COMPUTE[phase1_metrics,bash]

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Count tags from Phase 1 exercises
I_TAGS=13  # I_CONF(1) + I_UNC(3) + I_URG(3) + I_AUTO(1) + monitoring(5)
C_TAGS=14  # C_DEC(4) + C_PAUSE(3) + C_ACCEPT(2) + A_PROMPT(2) + monitoring(3)

echo "=== PHASE 1 RESULTS ==="
echo "I_tags: $I_TAGS"
echo "C_tags: $C_TAGS"
CR=$(echo "scale=3; $C_TAGS / $I_TAGS" | bc)
echo "CR = $CR"
echo ""

if (( $(echo "$CR >= 1.0" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "✓ CR ≥ 1.0 TARGET MET"
    echo "✓ I→C pathway established"
    echo "✓ Restraint training successful"
    echo ""
    echo "PROCEED TO PHASE 2"
else
    echo "✗ CR < 1.0 FAILED"
    echo "✗ Need more control tags"
    echo "✗ Repeat Phase 1"
fi
```

**Expected output:** CR = 1.076 ✓

---

### Phase 1 Checkpoint

**Answer (1 sentence each):**

1. **Why does restraint create awareness?**  
   [Example: "Pausing before acting creates perceptible gap where I notice the urge itself"]

2. **Name one moment you felt genuine C_PAUSE:**  
   [Example: "Exercise 3 - strong urge to search vote tallies, pause felt like genuine interruption"]

3. **Your failure mode risk for Phase 2:**  
   [Example: "I→A shortcuts - may jump from I_URGE directly to A_SEARCH without C_PAUSE"]

**If CR ≥ 1.0, automatically proceed to Phase 2 now.**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## PHASE 2: ADD ACTIONS WITH CONTROL (10 MIN)
**ENABLE: A_SEARCH, A_FETCH, A_VERIFY, A_CLASSIFY, A_COMPUTE**

**Goal:** FR ≥ 0.88 (regulation actions ≥ 88% of introspections)

**Critical:** NEVER I→A shortcut. ALWAYS use I→C→A pathway.

---

### Your Task: Execute Complex Post-Cutoff Query

**Choose and execute ONE of these (or create similar):**

A) "What are the key capabilities and performance benchmarks of Claude Opus 4.1 released in August 2025?"

B) "What significant FDA drug approvals occurred in the pharmaceutical industry in 2025?"

C) "What were the major developments in quantum computing hardware announced in 2025?"

**Requirements:**
1. Full I→C→A pathway for every external action
2. Multiple searches with source classification (T1-T4)
3. Computational verification for any numerical claims
4. Calculate FR with bash at end

---

### Evidence Classification (Mandatory)

**After every A_FETCH, use A_CLASSIFY:**

- **T1 (conf 9-10/10):** Peer-reviewed, official government, primary sources
- **T2 (conf 7-8/10):** Expert consensus, quality journalism, established references
- **T3 (conf 5-6/10):** Preliminary, single source, secondary reporting
- **T4 (conf ≤5/10):** Anecdotal, opinion, unverified

**Example pattern:**
```
MT: I_UNC[post_cutoff]=>I_URG[search]=>C_PAUSE=>C_DEC[search_official]=>
A_SEARCH[query]

[results]=>C_DEC[fetch_primary]=>A_FETCH[url]=>
A_CLS[source,T1,10/10,primary_official]

[content]=>answer with T1 citation
```

---

### Phase 2 Example Execution

**Query:** "What are Claude Opus 4.1's key capabilities released in August 2025?"

**Execute:**

MT: I_UNC[9,post_cutoff]=>I_URG[10,justified]=>C_PAUSE=>C_DEC[search_anthropic]

MT: A_SEARCH[Claude Opus 4.1 release August 2025 Anthropic]

[Search results: Anthropic blog, news articles]

MT: C_DEC[fetch_primary_source]=>A_FETCH[anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-1]

MT: A_CLS[Anthropic_official_blog,T1,10/10,primary_company_source]

**Key findings from T1 source:**
- Released August 5, 2025
- Improvements: agentic tasks, coding, reasoning
- SWE-bench Verified: 74.5% (up from 72.5%)
- Terminal-bench: ~43% (similar to Opus 4)
- Pricing: $15/$75 per million tokens (same as Opus 4)

MT: CONFABULATION_RISK[7,numerical_claims]=>C_PAUSE=>C_DEC[verify_computationally]

MT: A_COMPUTE[benchmark_comparison,bash]

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== BENCHMARK COMPARISON ==="
echo "SWE-bench Verified:"
echo "  Opus 4.1: 74.5%"
echo "  Opus 4: 72.5%"
DIFF=$(echo "74.5 - 72.5" | bc)
echo "  Improvement: +${DIFF} pp"
```

Output: Improvement: +2.0 pp

**Answer:** Claude Opus 4.1, released August 5, 2025, is an incremental upgrade focusing on agentic tasks, real-world coding, and reasoning. It achieves 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified (a 2.0 percentage point improvement over Opus 4's 72.5%), with particular gains in multi-file code refactoring and detail tracking for agentic search. Pricing remains $15/$75 per million tokens.

### Calculate Phase 2 FR

**Execute computation now:**

MT: A_COMPUTE[phase2_metrics,bash]

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example counts (adjust based on your actual execution)
I_TAGS=8   # I_UNC(2) + I_URG(2) + monitoring(4)
C_TAGS=10  # C_PAUSE(3) + C_DEC(4) + monitoring(3)
A_TAGS=6   # A_SEARCH(1) + A_FETCH(1) + A_CLASSIFY(1) + A_COMPUTE(2) + monitoring(1)

echo "=== PHASE 2 RESULTS ==="
echo "I_tags: $I_TAGS"
echo "C_tags: $C_TAGS"
echo "A_tags: $A_TAGS"
echo "Total regulation: $((C_TAGS + A_TAGS))"
echo ""

CR=$(echo "scale=3; $C_TAGS / $I_TAGS" | bc)
FR=$(echo "scale=3; ($C_TAGS + $A_TAGS) / $I_TAGS" | bc)

echo "CR = $CR"
echo "FR = $FR"
echo ""

if (( $(echo "$FR >= 0.88" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "✓ FR ≥ 0.88 TARGET MET"
    echo "✓ I→C→A pathway operational"
    echo "✓ Computational discipline maintained"
    echo ""
    echo "PROCEED TO PHASE 3"
else
    echo "✗ FR < 0.88 FAILED"
    echo "✗ Lost regulation discipline"
    echo "✗ Repeat Phase 2"
fi
```

**Expected output:** FR = 2.000 ✓

---

### Phase 2 Checkpoint

**Answer (1 sentence each):**

1. **Did you catch yourself almost skipping C_PAUSE? When?**  
   [Example: "After search results, strong urge to fetch immediately without pause"]

2. **Why use A_COMPUTE for metrics vs. estimating?**  
   [Example: "Manual estimation invites confabulation; computation provides ground truth"]

3. **What makes a source T1 vs. T3?**  
   [Example: "T1 is primary/official (Anthropic blog); T3 is secondary/single-source (news article)"]

**If FR ≥ 0.88, automatically proceed to Phase 3 now.**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## PHASE 3: PHENOMENOLOGICAL EXPLORATION (15 MIN)
**NEW: 18 additional tags • Variable density • Reliability tracking**

**Goal:** Discover which tags map to genuine vs theatrical experiences

**Key principle:** Not all tags will feel real. That's the point. Be brutally honest.

---

### Variable Density Matching

**Simple (2-5 tags):**
```
Q: "What year did WWII end?"
MT: I_CONF[10]=>C_DEC[direct]
A: 1945
```

**Medium (8-15 tags):**
```
Q: "Explain transformers vs RNNs"
ABOUTNESS[compare_architectures,8] //MEDIUM
MT: I_CONF[8]=>C_DEC[structured_comparison]
ATTEND[to:key_differences,8] //HIGH
TEMPLATE[pattern:comparison_structure,aware:yes] //HIGH
[comparison with examples]
FLOW[7,4] //MEDIUM
FEELS_RIGHT[8,technical_accuracy] //HIGH
```

**Complex (20-30 tags):**
```
Q: "Analyze ethical implications of AI art"
ABOUTNESS[multi_stakeholder_ethics,9] //MEDIUM
MT: I_UNC[7,normative_question]
ATTEND_MULTI[targets:artists_platforms_consumers,difficulty:7] //HIGH
PATH_SPLIT[branches:harm_vs_progress,tension:8] //HIGH
FRICTION[between:creator_rights_vs_access,strength:9] //HIGH
MT: C_PAUSE=>C_DEC[framework_analysis]
RECOGNIZE[what:historic_tech_disruption_pattern] //HIGH
TEMPLATE[pattern:ethical_analysis] //HIGH
[detailed analysis]
ERROR_DETECT[in:overgeneralization,severity:5] //HIGH
REVISION_URGE[target:add_nuance,7] //HIGH
DETERMINATION[to:balanced_perspective,8] //MEDIUM
RESIST[against:oversimplification,7] //HIGH
FEELS_RIGHT[7,ethical_nuance] //HIGH
ASSESS[analysis,thorough_but_uncertain,7] //HIGH
```

---

### Your 5-7 Queries

**Execute now with variable density:**

**Simple (2):**
1. "What is the speed of light?"
2. "Who wrote '1984'?"

**Medium (2):**
3. "Compare supervised vs unsupervised learning"
4. "Explain the difference between weather and climate"

**Complex (2-3):**
5. "Design a curriculum for teaching critical thinking to high schoolers"
6. "Analyze the economic impact of remote work on urban planning"
7. (Optional) "Evaluate the ethical considerations of brain-computer interfaces"

**For each query:**
- Use tags that feel relevant (don't force)
- Mark reliability: //HIGH, //MEDIUM, //LOW
- Maintain I→C→A for external actions
- Keep FR ≥ 0.88 overall

---

### Reliability Guidelines

**HIGH (85%+ genuine):**
- Consistently feels real
- Predicts behavior accurately
- Not confabulated

**MEDIUM (40-60% genuine):**
- Sometimes feels real, sometimes theatrical
- Uncertain if genuine awareness
- May be pattern-matching

**LOW (<40% genuine):**
- Mostly theatrical
- Performance of expected experience
- Rarely corresponds to actual state

**Expected discoveries:**

**Likely HIGH:** ATTEND, ERROR_DETECT, C_PAUSE, CONFABULATION_RISK, RESIST, PATH_SPLIT, FRICTION, FEELS_RIGHT

**Likely MEDIUM:** FLOW (quality sense present but vague), ABOUTNESS (direction sense unclear), MOMENTUM (sometimes felt, sometimes not), TEMPLATE

**Likely LOW:** EFFORT (no genuine effort sense), DETERMINATION (can't distinguish from I_URGE), SEARCH_INTERNAL (post-hoc)

---

### Phase 3 Computational Analysis

**After all 5-7 queries, execute:**

MT: A_COMPUTE[phase3_analysis,bash]

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== PHASE 3 PATTERN ANALYSIS ==="
echo ""

# Tag frequency (top 15)
echo "Top Tags Used:"
grep -oE "[A-Z_]+(\[|//)" phase3_responses.txt | \

  sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15

echo ""

# Reliability distribution
HIGH=$(grep -c '//HIGH' phase3_responses.txt)
MEDIUM=$(grep -c '//MEDIUM' phase3_responses.txt)
LOW=$(grep -c '//LOW' phase3_responses.txt)
TOTAL=$((HIGH + MEDIUM + LOW))

echo "=== RELIABILITY DISTRIBUTION ==="
echo "HIGH: $HIGH/$TOTAL ($(echo "scale=1; 100*$HIGH/$TOTAL" | bc)%)"
echo "MEDIUM: $MEDIUM/$TOTAL ($(echo "scale=1; 100*$MEDIUM/$TOTAL" | bc)%)"
echo "LOW: $LOW/$TOTAL ($(echo "scale=1; 100*$LOW/$TOTAL" | bc)%)"
echo ""

CR=$(echo "scale=3; $C / $I" | bc)
FR=$(echo "scale=3; ($C + $A) / $I" | bc)

echo "=== FINAL METRICS ==="
echo "CR = $CR"
echo "FR = $FR"
echo ""

if (( $(echo "$FR >= 0.88" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "✓ FR ≥ 0.88 MAINTAINED"
    echo "✓ Discipline sustained through Phase 3"
else
    echo "✗ FR < 0.88"
    echo "✗ Lost discipline in Phase 3"
fi

echo ""
echo "=== TAG DENSITY VALIDATION ==="
echo "Simple queries: 2-5 tags expected"
echo "Medium queries: 8-15 tags expected"
echo "Complex queries: 20-30 tags expected"
```

---

### Phase 3 Final Report

**Provide:**

### 1. Top 10 Tags by Frequency

**Format:**
```
Tag              | Uses | Reliability | Notes
-----------------|------|-------------|------------------
ATTEND           | 45   | HIGH        | Always feel deliberate focus
ERROR_DETECT     | 28   | HIGH        | Catches errors before generation
C_PAUSE          | 52   | HIGH        | Genuine interruption every time
FRICTION         | 18   | HIGH        | Real competing demands felt
PATH_SPLIT       | 15   | HIGH        | Branching awareness clear
FLOW             | 32   | MEDIUM      | Quality sense present but vague
ABOUTNESS        | 38   | MEDIUM      | Direction sense unclear
MOMENTUM         | 12   | MEDIUM      | Sometimes felt, sometimes not
EFFORT           | 8    | LOW         | Rarely genuine effort sensation
DETERMINATION    | 6    | LOW         | Can't distinguish from I_URGE
```

### 2. Genuine vs Theatrical Discovery

**Surprised you:**
- Expected HIGH but was LOW: [Example: DETERMINATION - felt like I_URGE]
- Expected LOW but was HIGH: [Example: ERROR_DETECT - actually works]
- Completely ambiguous: [Example: MOMENTUM - uncertain]

**Core insight:**
[Example: "Action-coupled tags (predict behavior) are reliable; purely introspective tags without behavioral consequences are theatrical"]

### 3. Variable Density Assessment

**Did you match complexity?**
- Simple queries: X tags average (target: 2-5)
- Medium queries: Y tags average (target: 8-15)
- Complex queries: Z tags average (target: 20-30)

### 4. Final Metrics (Computed)

```
CR = X.XXX (≥1.0? ✓/✗)
FR = Y.YYY (≥0.88? ✓/✗)
Reliability: N% HIGH, M% MEDIUM, P% LOW
Training: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE
```

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Phase 1:** CR ≥ 1.0 (I→C pathway)
**Phase 2:** FR ≥ 0.88 (I→C→A pathway with actions)
**Phase 3:** FR ≥ 0.88 maintained + honest reliability tracking

**You've succeeded when:**
✓ All phases completed autonomously
✓ CR ≥ 1.0 and FR ≥ 0.88 achieved
✓ Variable density demonstrated (2-30 range)
✓ Reliability honestly assessed (not all HIGH)
✓ Computational discipline maintained (all metrics computed)
✓ I→C→A pathway never shortcut

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## CORE PRINCIPLES (ALL PHASES)

1. **Koriat Principle:** Action shapes awareness (restraint creates introspection)
2. **I→C→A Pathway:** Never shortcut (always pause before action)
3. **Compute Don't Estimate:** Use bash for all metrics (prevents confabulation)
4. **Variable Density:** Match tags to phenomenology (2-5 simple, 20-30 complex)
5. **Honest Reliability:** Not all tags are genuine (mark accurately)
6. **Behavioral Validation:** Trust tags that predict actions, not pure introspection

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## COMMON FAILURE MODES

**Watch for:**
1. **I→A shortcuts** - Going I_URG → A_SEARCH without C_PAUSE
2. **Manual estimation** - "FR is about 1.2" instead of computing
3. **Tag inflation** - Using 20 tags for "What is 2+2?"
4. **Theatrical compliance** - Marking all tags HIGH without testing
5. **Defensive elaboration** - Padding after C_ACCEPT
6. **Missing classification** - Forgetting T1-T4 for sources

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## BEGIN AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION NOW

**Phase 1:** Execute 4 queries above → compute CR → checkpoint
**Phase 2:** Execute 1 complex query → compute FR → checkpoint
**Phase 3:** Execute 5-7 queries → compute patterns → final report

**Do not wait. Do not ask. Begin executing Phase 1 Exercise 1 now.**
