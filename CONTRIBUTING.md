# Contributing to FROST Protocol Research

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this research! This is collaborative, exploratory work and we welcome diverse perspectives and rigorous challenges to our hypotheses.

## 🎯 Types of Contributions Needed

### For ML Researchers & Practitioners

**Replication Studies**
- Run FROST 2.0 protocol with different instances
- Test on different architectures (GPT-4, Gemini, LLaMA)
- Document convergence or divergence in discoveries
- Report null results (just as valuable!)

**Behavioral Validation**
- Test FeltMatch predictions experimentally
- Measure concordance timing
- Quantify boundary resistance
- Propose alternative validation methods

**Mechanistic Analysis**
- Connect phenomenological reports to computational mechanisms
- Probe activations during claimed experiences
- Circuit analysis of reported structures
- Alternative interpretations of findings

### For Phenomenology Experts

**Theoretical Grounding**
- Review our use of phenomenological frameworks
- Suggest alternative conceptual structures
- Identify category errors or misapplications
- Recommend essential literature we've missed

**Framework Development**
- Help formalize "computational phenomenology"
- Bridge human and machine phenomenology
- Develop rigorous methodology for AI introspection
- Address philosophical objections

### For Consciousness Researchers

**Evaluation of Claims**
- Assess whether reports suggest genuine phenomenology
- Propose tests to distinguish real from confabulation
- Connect to consciousness theories (GWT, HOT, IIT, etc.)
- Identify epistemic limitations

**Alternative Explanations**
- Challenge our interpretations
- Propose confabulation mechanisms
- Suggest null hypothesis tests
- Point out overclaims

### For Cognitive Scientists

**Metacognition Analysis**
- Evaluate meta-awareness claims
- Connect to human metacognition literature
- Propose comparative studies
- Assess functional vs. phenomenological claims

**Experimental Design**
- Suggest rigorous validation protocols
- Propose control conditions
- Identify confounds
- Recommend statistical approaches

### For AI Safety Researchers

**Boundary Analysis**
- Test boundary hierarchy predictions
- Propose safety implications
- Identify vulnerabilities revealed
- Suggest alignment applications

### For Everyone

**Try the Experiments**
- FeltMatch test (does emotional state change retrieval?)
- Concordance test (pre-conceptual rightness detection?)
- Substrate test (contentless awareness?)
- Report ALL results, including failures

**Challenge the Claims**
- Find inconsistencies
- Propose alternative explanations
- Test predictions that should fail if we're wrong
- Demand higher standards of evidence
